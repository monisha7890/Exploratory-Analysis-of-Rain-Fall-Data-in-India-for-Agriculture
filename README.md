🎯 Problem Statement
  Agriculture in India is highly dependent on monsoon rainfall. Unpredictable rainfall patterns     lead to crop failure, financial loss, and inefficient irrigation planning.
There is a need for a data-driven system that:
-Analyzes historical rainfall trends
-Predicts future rainfall categories
-Supports farmers and agricultural officers in decision-making

📌 Project Overview
  The Exploratory Rainfall Prediction System is a Machine Learning-based web application designed   to analyze historical rainfall data in India and predict rainfall categories to support   agricultural planning.
The system performs:
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on rainfall datasets
-Seasonal and state-wise trend analysis
-Rainfall category prediction (Low / Normal / High)
-Web-based deployment using Flask
This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture for data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Rainfall Category Prediction (Low / Normal / High)
- Machine Learning Models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Flask-based Web Application
- Data Visualization (Bar Chart, Line Chart, Heatmap)
- Real-time Prediction (< 2 seconds response time)
